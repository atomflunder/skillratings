//! The FIFA Men's rating algorithm, officially called *The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking*.  
//! Used to rank men's national football (or soccer) teams in FIFA-recognised competitions since 2018.
//!
//! The algorithm is largely based on the Elo rating system, but with a few modifications specific to football (soccer).  
//! The main differences being an importance factor, that rates the importance of a given match,
//! and a penalty-shootout factor that accounts for the fact that penalty shootouts are often more random than regular play.
//!
//! Please note that the FIFA Women's ranking algorithm works in a very different way, and is not implemented in this crate.
//! This is due to the way the outcome and score of the match is taken into account in the calculations.  
//! For more information please see the [Wikipedia Article on FIFA Women's World Rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women%27s_World_Rankings).
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! ```
//! use skillratings::{
//!     fifa::{fifa, FifaConfig, FifaRating},
//!     Outcomes,
//! };
//!
//! // Initialise a new team rating.
//! let team_one = FifaRating::new();
//!
//! // Or you can initialise it with your own values of course.
//! // Imagine these numbers being pulled from a database.
//! let some_rating = 1325.0;
//! let team_two = FifaRating {
//!     rating: some_rating,
//! };
//!
//! // The outcome of the match is from the perspective of team one.
//! let outcome = Outcomes::WIN;
//!
//! // The config allows you to specify certain values in the Fifa calculation.
//! // Here we set the importance factor to 50.0, and the knockout factor to false.
//! // Which corresponds to a World Cup Group Stage match.
//! let config = FifaConfig {
//!     importance: 50.0,
//!     knockout: false,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! };
//!
//! // The fifa function will calculate the new ratings for both teams and return them.
//! let (new_team_one, new_team_two) = fifa(&team_one, &team_two, &outcome, &config);
//! ```
