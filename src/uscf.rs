//! The USCF (US Chess Federation) Rating Algorithm, developed by Mark Glickman as an improvement on Elo.  
//! Used to rate US Chess events in favour of Elo, and continues to be enhanced over the years.
//!
//! This rating system was, just like Glicko, developed by Mark Glickman, and is thus heavily influenced by it.
//!
//! This implementation of the USCF Rating System uses the formulas found in the
//! [Approximating Formulas for the US Chess Rating System](http://www.glicko.net/ratings/approx.pdf) document,
//! and thus may yield *slightly* different calculations to the proper formulas in some circumstances,
//! specifically if a player has 8 or less games played, with only wins or only losses.
//!
//! Also, this implementation can not determine rating floors for each player, except the most basic floor.  
//! This is due to the rating floor being determined by the *all-time highest* rating for each player, which we cannot know.  
//! This is something you need to keep track of yourself, unfortunately.  
//! The formula for calculating a rating floor (the lowest rating possible) of a player is the player's highest ever achieved rating,
//! subtracted by 200 points and then using the floor just below that.
//! As of 2022, rating floors exist at every 100 point mark between 1200 and 2100.  
//! For example, a player with an all-time highest rating of 1941 has a rating floor of 1700.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! This is the most basic example on how to use the USCF Module.  
//! Please take a look at the functions below to see more advanced use cases.
//!
//! ```
//! use skillratings::{
//!     uscf::{uscf, USCFConfig, USCFRating},
//!     Outcomes,
//! };
//!
//! // Initialise a new player rating.
//! // We need to set the actual age for the player,
//! // if you are unsure what to set here, set this to 26.
//! let player_one = USCFRating::new(18);
//!
//! // Or you can initialise it with your own values of course.
//! // Imagine these numbers being pulled from a database.
//! let (some_rating, some_games) = (1325.0, 44);
//! let player_two = USCFRating {
//!     rating: some_rating,
//!     games: some_games,
//! };
//!
//! // The outcome of the match is from the perspective of player one.
//! let outcome = Outcomes::WIN;
//!
//! // The config allows you to specify the t value in the USCF calculation.
//! // It determines how easy or hard it is to gain bonus rating points.
//! // The recommended value changes periodically, as of right now it is 14.0.
//! // Here we set it to 12.0, the recommended value from 2015 to 2017.
//! let config = USCFConfig { t: 12.0 };
//!
//! // The uscf function will calculate the new ratings for both players and return them.
//! let (new_player_one, new_player_two) = uscf(&player_one, &player_two, &outcome, &config);
//! ```
