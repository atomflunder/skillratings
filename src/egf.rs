//! The EGF (European Go Federation) rating system is a variation of the Elo rating system, adapted for playing Go.  
//! Used for calculating Go player ratings in Europe since 1998.
//!
//! The ratings are loosely centred around the Go ranks, ranging from 30 *kyu* (lowest) to 9 *dan* (highest).  
//! A rating of 2100 equals a rank of 1 *dan*, and 1 rank up and down equals a gain or loss of around 100 points.  
//! So a 2 *dan* rank would equal around 2200 points, and so on. The lowest rank, 30 *kyu*, is equal to -900 points.  
//! You start at a rating of 0, around 21 *kyu*.
//! The [full table of ranks/rating can be found here](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoR),
//! or [here is an unofficial comparison table](https://forums.online-go.com/t/go-ranks-vs-chess-ratings/41594/42)
//! that includes USCF chess ratings.
//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! This is the most basic example on how to use the EGF Module.  
//! Please take a look at the functions below to see more advanced use cases.
//!
//! ```
//! use skillratings::{
//!     egf::{egf, EGFConfig, EGFRating},
//!     Outcomes,
//! };
//!
//! // Initialise a new player rating with a rating of 0.
//! let player_one = EGFRating::new();
//!
//! // Or you can initialise it with your own values of course.
//! // Imagine these numbers being pulled from a database.
//! let some_rating = 325.0;
//! let player_two = EGFRating {
//!     rating: some_rating,
//! };
//!
//! // The outcome of the match is from the perspective of player one.
//! let outcome = Outcomes::WIN;
//!
//! // The config allows you to specify certain values in the EGF calculation.
//! // We set a handicap of 4.0 here for player one.
//! // This means that player_two starts with 4 handicap stones.
//! // For more details see the "Handicapping in Go" link below.
//! let config = EGFConfig { handicap: 4.0 };
//!
//! // The egf function will calculate the new ratings for both players and return them.
//! let (new_player_one, new_player_two) = egf(&player_one, &player_two, &outcome, &config);
//! ```
